# Personal Loan Campaign – Classification Project

This project builds predictive models to identify customers likely to accept personal loan offers using customer demographic and financial data.

## 📌 Objective
Develop a classification model to enhance marketing efforts and increase the efficiency of loan targeting.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

## 🧪 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **EDA Highlights:**
   - High-income and CD account holders are more likely to accept loans
   - Education and credit card ownership influence acceptance rates

3. **Modeling & Evaluation:**
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - Best results achieved with Random Forest

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
- Target customers with high income and CD accounts
- Focus on customers aged 30–50 with credit cards
